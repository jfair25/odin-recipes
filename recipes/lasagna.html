    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more tradtitional homemade
        lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but this recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and
        Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Server with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
