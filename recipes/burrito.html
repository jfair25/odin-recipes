    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Here is my recipe for the much loved Ground Beef Burrito! The key to this burrito in achieving that authentic
        Mexican flavor and mouth feel, is in the method for cooking the ground beef. If you decide to brown your ground
        beef or follow the directions on the spice package, you will end up with a totally different product.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound 90% lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 5/8 ounces dry burrito mix</li>
        <li>3/4 - 1 cup water</li>
        <li>4 burrito-sized flour tortillas</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons sour cream</li>
        <li>1 cup four-cheese Mexican blen cheese</li>
        <li>2 roma tomatoes, diced</li>
        <li>4 green onions, sliced</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons salsa</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>With your clean hands start by adding 3/4 to 1 cup warm water and the burrito seasoning packet in a large
            pot. Place the raw hamburger in the liquit and use your hands to break all down so there are no chucks.
            Bring the mixture to a full boil then reduce the heat and allow to simmer stirring occasionally, until all
            the liquid has been absorbed</li>
        <li>Place a tortilla on a plate and cover with a damp towel. Microwave on high for 15 seconds. Remove tortilla
            from the microwave, uncover. Slightly off center of the tortilla, spread on 2 tablespoons of sour cream on
            the tortilla. Place 1/4 of the ground beef on top of the sour cream. Place 1/4 cup of the cheese blend on
            top of the ground beef. Sprinkle on tomatoes and green onions.</li>
        <li>Fold the front of the tortilla over the filling. Tuck the left and right sides of the tortilla inside as you
            roll. Roll the belly on top of the back so the weight of the filling holds it together.</li>
    </ol>
